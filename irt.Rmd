title: "What is Item Response Theory?"
---


Item Response Theory (IRT) traditionally is applied in standardized testing 
theory. IRT models the relationship between unobservable proficiency with
observed performance. The probability that a student responds correctly 
depends upon their individual proficiency and the difficulty of the question. 
The Rasch model gives an equation for calculating the probability of a correct
response:

$$P(X_{ni} = 1) = \frac{\exp(\theta_n - b_i)}{1 + \exp(\theta_n - b_i)}$$

Where $\theta_n$ is the proficiency associated with the $n^{th}$ student and
$b_i$ is the difficulty associated with the $i^{th}$ question. We can apply 
the same logic to finger prints analysts in testing situations. Each examiner 
receives a proficiency on their responses and each latent print is given a 
difficulty.
