title: "Getting to Know the Black Box Study"
---

**The Purpose**

The Black Box Study was performed to examine the accuracy of finger print 
analysts. Correct responses were recorded as individualizing mated pairs as 
well as excluding non-mated pairs. The researchers aimed to calculate the 
false positive and false negative rate of the examiners in the study. 

**The Results**

The false positive rate was calculated to be 0.1% while the false negative 
rate was calculated at 7.5%. Additionally, 85% of examiners made a false 
negative conclusion in the study. This further raised questions about the 
decision making process and the use of analysts within the criminal justice 
system.
